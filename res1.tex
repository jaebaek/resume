%        \emph{Summary:} Mobile app developers often adopt third-party libraries in their apps.
%        Such integration with third-party libraries comes with the cost
%        of potential privacy violations of users, because they have same permissions
%        which their apps have.
%        To solve this problem, we suggest FLEXDROID that provides dynamic,
%        fine-grained access control for third-party libraries.
%        The key idea of FLEXDROID is to apply secure and suitable stack inspection
%        to Android.
%        Since the Android permission checkers (i.e., PM and kernel ACL checker) reside out of user apps,
%        we design a secure IPC to deliver the call stack of each user app to the permission checkers
%        (we call it \textit{Inter-process Stack Inspection}).
%        In addition, since third-party libraries can circumvent the inter-process stack inspection by JNI,
%        we sandbox JNI code of third-party libraries using the \textit{Fault Isolation} based on \textit{ARM Memory Domain}
%        (i.e., in-process memory isolation)
%        to prevent third-party libraries from counterfeiting the call stack directly or indirectly.
%        Because of the sandbox, JNI code of third-party libraries causes faults
%        when accessing shared libraries (e.g., \textsf{libc}), heap and other memory out of the sandbox.
%        Thus, we provide JNI code with independent shared libraries (e.g., \textsf{libc}), heap, stack and TLS for JNI.
%   \vspace{0.1in}\\
%        \emph{My contribution:} I engineered all system components alone.
%        The components include a character device driver for IPC,
%        Dalvik VM for handling JNI code, Android linker to support independent shared libraries,
%        independent heap (i.e., malloc), independent TLS, Android framework components related to access control and so on.
